        <p class="dropcap">There is no more important nutrient for our bodies than water.  No other substance is as widely involved in the processes and make up of the body.  A man's body is about 60 percent water, and a woman's is approximately 50 percent.  Did you know that the human brain is about 75 percent water?</p>

        <h3>Adding Water to Your Routine</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Keep a supply of water containers full in the fridge. That way, water is always on hand as an alternative to other less healthful drinks and conveniently available when you’re on the go.</li>
            
            <li>Upon arriving at the office, fill up a big jug of water at the tap. You’ll get plenty of water to drink throughout your workday.</li>
            
            <li>Caffeinated beverages act as diuretics and increase fluid loss, so they don’t count toward your daily hydration needs. Try substituting water for your second cup of coffee or that mid- afternoon soda.</li>
            
            <li>Don't wait for your body to signal it's thirsty. By that time, you're already starting to be dehydrated.</li>
        
        </ul>
